NEED TO HANDLE WHEN THERE ARE NO SELLERS AND NO PRICE ON A LISTING (AMAZON)


/need to test //0. add the "old tags" field and edit the tag string accordingly so it can be copy / paste rather than editng

//0.1 have opt script grab tags, current price, asin/upc

0.2 have all guys send me their scripts, keep in separate files for updates

#tutorial / setup gui
#persist settings in file
##settings saved: sleep factor (slider), coord positions (include pictures in setup? -- yes)
[go by order, most important below - numbers are labels from here down]

    0.25 add a basic popup with the important keys that runs on startup of the script or at [hotkey]
        key for tutorial    
        key for "setup" - 0.55
        key for running script
    
    0.55 create a gui for script setup, enter in speific cooridinate values in a box and hit enter, these all get saved as hard code

                **idea!!!
                    tooltip with field name click for coordinates
                        verify y/n
                        insert into field on file (fileappend)
                        if start point, save in start_no_paste
                        minus point 2 from 

    0.3 add a slider gui to intake a value between 1.01 and 2.00 to adjust the time values for Sleep given a slowdown or speedup

    0.5 add a pop up gui on hotkey for key reference and with a collapsable tutorial [integrate with 0.25]
